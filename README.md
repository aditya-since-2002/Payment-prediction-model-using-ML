>Data Analysis is a process of collecting, transforming, cleaning, and modeling data with the goal of discovering the required information. The results so obtained are communicated, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making

Following process 
- Data collection
- Data processing
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis 
- Spliting data -> test and train
- model implementation
- getting values

>Why Processing?
Data processing, manipulation of data by a computer. It includes the conversion of raw data to machine-readable form, flow of data through the CPU and memory to output devices, and formatting or transformation of output. Any use of computers to perform defined operations on data can be included under data processing.

>What is the difference between train data and test data?
In machine learning, datasets are split into two subsets. The first subset is known as the training data - it's a portion of our actual dataset that is fed into the machine learning model to discover and learn patterns. In this way, it trains our model. The other subset is known as the testing data
